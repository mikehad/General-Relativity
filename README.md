# General-Relativity

This Mathematica Script calculates tensors in General Relativity.
To execute it, we need the local coodinates "xx" and a metric "g".
In the pdf, all tensors are shown, as well as an example how to execute the script.
One can use this script to calcualte other tensors, or to solve the Einstein Field equations.
